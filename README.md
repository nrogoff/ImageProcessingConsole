## Functionality and How to use
As new functionality comes online, then this sections will be updated.
### Update EXIF 'Date Taken'
For various reasons photographic images sometimes do not have their **'Date Taken'** (also known as 'Digitized Date' or 'Original Date'). 
Cataloging tools (e.g. OneDrive or Google Drive Photos or Windows Photos App) will then usually resort to sorting and cataloging your photos by Created or Modified date. This can be pretty confusing, especially when you have copied and/or edited digital photo's or created photos by scanning old film and slides.

This tool has the capability to update one or more images 'Date Taken' EXIF metadata.

By default, if an image already has a 'Shot Taken Date' then any images files will NOT be updated.
If you do not supply a new 'Shot Taken Date' then the tool will search for an existing image (nearest first) in the same folder that has a valid date.

#### Use

The command line syntax (you can use the short or long form option switches. Note: long form require two preceeding dashes '--'):
